    2 Different types of memory are available for us to store variables/values in

    1. Stack
        - Quicker to access and read from
        - Ordered structure
        - Local variables (primitive) and references to objects

    2. Heap
        - Slower to access and read from
        - Non-ordered structure
        - Non-primitive objects
